[CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013)](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/)

## Course Description

Haskell is a high-level, pure functional programming language with a strong static type system and elegant mathematical underpinnings, and is being increasingly used in industry by organizations such as Facebook, AT&T, and NASA. In the first 3/4 of the course, we will explore the joys of pure, lazy, typed functional programming in Haskell (warning: euphoric, mind-bending epiphanies may result!). The last 1/4 of the course will consist of case studies in fun and interesting applications of Haskell. Potential case study topics include automated randomized testing, software transactional memory, graphics generation, parser combinators, or others as time and interest allow. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly programming assignments, and an open-ended final project.
